# SwiftMoney â€” Angular Starter Repo

This repository is a **git-ready starter** for an Angular app that combines the best features of Mulya and Skydo. It contains a minimal but runnable Angular project skeleton with Tailwind support and the core components (Header, Hero, Calculator) plus a mocked PricingService.

## Quick start (from README)

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd swiftmoney
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
ng serve --open
```

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes
- Replace mocked PricingService with real HTTP calls to your backend when ready.
- Tailwind is configured in postcss & tailwind.config; ensure Angular build picks it up (see Tailwind docs for Angular).
